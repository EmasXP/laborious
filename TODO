- Model::buildSelectColumns()
- Model::__construct() $from_prefix
- Iterator::asArray()
- ForwardIterator::asArray()
- Connection:
	- Support for NULL
	- Quote table and column names
- Model::reload()
- Model::loaded()

TO CHECK:
- Can the model receive PDO objects (not assoc arrays)

TO CONSIDER:
- Model::getFields() - or maybe it should be called getColumns()
- Model::getKeysAndFields() - bad name though. Should return the keys of $_values and the ones that are missing from $_fields.

TO THINK ABOUT:
This scenraio:

$user = new User;
$user->email = "test@example.com";
$user->save();
print $user->username;

This will be NULL because of filters. Does this mean that __get() should return NULL on them after all?

- Iterator::asArray()
- ForwardIterator::asArray()
- Connection:
	- Quote table and column names (PDO does not support this)
- loadModelFromObject() should check if loaded(), populating a loaded object is dangerous and should not be allowed.
- hasPrefix()
- hasPrefix() in combination with MetaData
- Rename exceptions?
	- Labourious/Exception
	- Labourious/Exception/Database
	- Labourious/Exception/Validation
- Suggest PDO attributes
	- Write about what happens when objects are passed

TESTS TO WRITE:
- loadModel(): Fetching the correct rows.
- loadModel(): Fetching sub-sub model.
- loadModel(): Fetching sub of sub model.
- Connection::buildWhere() with NULL.
- Connection::executeUpdate() with NULL.
- Connection::executeInsert() with NULL.
- Pass NULL to setRawValues() and __construct()
- Pass object to setRawValues() and __construct()
- Verify that reload() empties changes

TO CHECK:
- loadModelFromObject() might be faster using setRawValues() now when the implementation of that method has changed.

TO CONSIDER:
- Model::getFields() - or maybe it should be called getColumns()
- Model::getKeysAndFields() - bad name though. Should return the keys of $_values and the ones that are missing from $_fields.

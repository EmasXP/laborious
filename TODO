- Throw exception in delete() on non-loaded objects.
- Model::reload()
- Model::loaded()
- Model::buildSelectColumns()
- Model::__construct() $from_prefix
- Iterator::asArray()
- ForwardIterator::asArray()
- Connection:
	- Support for NULL in SET, WHERE and so on.
	- Quote table and column names

TO CHECK:
- Can the model receive PDO objects (not assoc arrays)

TO CONSIDER:
- Model::getFields() - or maybe it should be called getColumns()
- Model::getKeysAndFields() - bad name though. Should return the keys of $_values and the ones that are missing from $_fields.

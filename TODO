- Throw exception in delete() on non-loaded objects.
- Model::reload()
- Model::loaded()
- Model::loadModel()
- Iterator::asArray()
- ForwardIterator::asArray()
- Connection:
	- Support for NULL in SET, WHERE and so on.
	- Quote table and column names (PDO does not support this)
- Possibility to pass objects instead of dictionaries to _construct().
- loadModelFromObject() should check if loaded(), populating a loaded object is dangerous and should not be allowed.

TESTS TO WRITE:
- loadModel(): Fetching the correct rows.
- loadModel(): Fetching sub-sub model.
- loadModel(): Fetching sub of sub model.
- Connection::buildWhere() with NULL.
- Connection::executeUpdate() with NULL.
- Connection::executeInsert() with NULL.

TO CHECK:
- Can the model receive PDO objects (not assoc arrays)

TO CONSIDER:
- Model::getFields() - or maybe it should be called getColumns()
- Model::getKeysAndFields() - bad name though. Should return the keys of $_values and the ones that are missing from $_fields.
